        Pansies typically display large showy face markings. The Joker Series has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Plants grow well in sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals because of their leggy growth.
