<h1>pansy</h1>
<p>Pansies typically display large showy face markings. The Joker Series has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Plants grow well in sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals because of their leggy growth.</p>

<h1>bleeding heart</h1>
<p>There is a Japanese version that it is a sword and the prince who is so distraught by a broken heart, kills himself with it: stabs himself with the sword in the heart. Then the princess finds out and she realizes that his love was true and she weeps forevermore, hence the bleeding hearts.</p>

<h1>daisy</h1>
<p>Bellis perennis is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 20 centimetres (8 inches) in height.[4] It has short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 2 to 5 cm (3⁄4–2 in) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing, hence the term 'lawn daisy'. It blooms from March to September[4] and exhibits the phenomenon of heliotropism, in which the flowers follow the position of the sun in the sky.

The flowerheads are composite, about 2 to 3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) in diameter, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on a single leafless stem 2 to 10 cm (3⁄4–4 in), rarely 15 cm (6 in) tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as "phyllaries".[5] The achenes are without pappu</p>
